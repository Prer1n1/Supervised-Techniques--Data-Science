# Supervised-Techniques--Data-Science

This project implements and evaluates two machine learning classifiers—Decision Tree and Gaussian Naive Bayes—for binary classification of medical diagnosis data. The implementation includes custom-built classifiers that incorporate information gain for decision trees and Gaussian probability calculations for Naive Bayes.

Additionally, the project explores feature selection, dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and data augmentation using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to enhance model performance and robustness on imbalanced datasets.
